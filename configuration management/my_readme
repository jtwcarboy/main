#script documentation
put the list of your systems in /tmp/systems  These should be one column of ip's or hostnames (must be resolvable) 
This is going to run as user jtw which we will have an ssh key pair setup so no password prompt occurs 
use ssh-keygen to create a key before utilizing the script written,  Public key should be distributed across all systems
Once you have your list of systemms in /tmp/systems then run the script.sh to deploy the new template file contents.

The script reads the exit code and makes a file with a list of good / bad and counts them to the screen to show you failures
(this part needed some more tuning because its reading only the success of the ssh command and not the commands ran on remote system)
